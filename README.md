# Distributed-Coresets

CMUã€€Machine Learning in Big Data 10-805 Porject

The project implemented a streaming and parallelized algorithm for coresets construction. The features includes:
- Open MPI C++ based
- Interface based

You can easily implement your own coresets construction algorithm based on our framework. Our framework will help you easily distribute it.
